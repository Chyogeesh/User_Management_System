# User_Management_System
It is a internship assignment
A User Management System is a fundamental component of many web applications, allowing users to register, login, logout, and manage their profiles. In this assignment, we utilized PHP, a server-side scripting language, to implement key functionalities of a User Management System.

Key Components of the User Management System:

User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing a username and password. The system securely stores user credentials in a database after hashing the password for security.

User Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their username and password. The system verifies the credentials against the stored data and initiates a session upon successful authentication.

User Logout: Users can securely log out of their accounts, terminating the session and ensuring data privacy.

Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, such as username and password, to maintain accuracy and security.

Conclusion:

Building a User Management System using PHP empowers web developers to create secure and user-friendly applications. By implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, developers can ensure data integrity and protect user privacy. Furthermore, integrating additional features such as email verification, password recovery, and role-based access control can enhance the functionality and usability of the system.
